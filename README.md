# Collatz Conjecture Generator
This program aims to be one of the fastest generators of the Collatz Conjecture. I am not really sure what you want to use it for.

## New branch
The `new` branch was a WIP branch, where I was trying to make it multithreaded, but after bad results, I stopped working on it.

## Usage
Run the program without any arguments to get the usage. Here is the output of running the program without any arguments.
```sh
g	Generate numbers in binary format
	ccg g <output binary file> <start> <stop> (<buffer size>)
c	Convert from binary to csv format
	ccg c <binary input file> <csv output file> (<buffer size>)
```
